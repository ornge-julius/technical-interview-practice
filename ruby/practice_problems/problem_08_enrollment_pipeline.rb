# =============================================================================
# Patient Enrollment Pipeline
# =============================================================================
#
# A clinical care program moves patients through a structured enrollment
# pipeline. Each patient begins in the "referred" state and advances through
# a predefined set of transitions until reaching a terminal state.
#
# Allowed transitions (defined in ALLOWED_TRANSITIONS below):
#   referred   ->  screened
#   screened   ->  enrolled  |  ineligible
#   enrolled   ->  active    |  withdrawn
#   active     ->  graduated |  churned  |  withdrawn
#
# Terminal states: ineligible, withdrawn, graduated, churned
#
# You choose the internal data structures — the public interface is what
# matters.
#
# Store all state in instance variables set in `initialize`. Class variables
# and class-level instance variables will bleed between examples and between
# EnrollmentPipeline instances — avoid them.

#   pipeline.transition("p_001", "screened", 86400.0)   # 1 day later

#   pipeline.get_patients_in_state("enrolled")  # -> ["p_001"]
#
#   pipeline.add_patient("p_002", 0.0)
#   pipeline.transition("p_002", "screened", 43200.0)
#   pipeline.transition("p_002", "ineligible", 86400.0)
#   pipeline.get_patients_in_state("screened")  # -> []  (both have moved on)
#
#   # Part 2
#   pipeline.time_in_state("p_001", "screened", 999999.0)
#   # -> 86400.0  (172800 - 86400; already exited, as_of ignored)
#   pipeline.conversion_rate("screened", "enrolled")
#   # -> 0.5  (p_001 enrolled, p_002 ineligible; one of two converted)
#
#   # Part 3
#   pipeline.transition("p_001", "active", 259200.0)
#   pipeline.patients_overdue("active", 3600.0, 270000.0)
#   # -> ["p_001"]  (has been active 10800 s > 3600 s threshold)
#   pipeline.average_time_in_state("screened", 999999.0)
#   # -> 64800.0  ((86400 + 43200) / 2; both p_001 and p_002 have exited screened)
