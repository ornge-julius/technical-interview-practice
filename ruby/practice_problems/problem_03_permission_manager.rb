# =============================================================================
# INTERVIEW PROBLEM 3: Permission Manager (RBAC)
# Difficulty: Senior Software Engineer | Estimated time: 45 min
# =============================================================================
#
# CONTEXT
# -------
# Almost every production application has some form of Role-Based Access Control:
# a SaaS product with admin/member/viewer tiers, a dev tool with repo-level
# permissions, a document platform with edit/comment/view roles, etc.
#
# You're implementing an in-memory RBAC engine from scratch. You choose the
# internal data structures — the class's public interface is what matters.
#
# HOW IT WORKS
# ------------
#   - Roles hold a set of permission strings (e.g. "billing:read", "users:write").
#   - Users are assigned one or more roles.
#   - A user "has" a permission if any of their roles grant it.
#   - In Part 2, roles can inherit from a parent role (permissions flow downward).
#   - In Part 3, permission strings use "resource:action" format with wildcards.
#
# NOTES
# -----
#   - Users do not need to be pre-registered. Assigning a role to a user_id
#     that hasn't been seen before creates the user implicitly.
#   - You may assume no cycles will be introduced in the role hierarchy.
#   - Choose whatever internal data structures you like (Hash, Set, etc.).
#   - role_id and user_id are caller-supplied string slugs (e.g. "admin", "alice").
#   - Store all state in instance variables set in initialize. Class variables
#     (@@foo) and class-level instance variables will bleed state between
#     PermissionManager instances and between example runs — avoid them.
#
# EXAMPLE
# -------
#   pm = PermissionManager.new
#   pm.create_role("admin", ["users:write", "billing:read"])
#   pm.create_role("viewer", ["posts:read"])
#   pm.assign_role("alice", "admin")
#   pm.assign_role("bob", "viewer")
#
#   pm.has_permission?("alice", "billing:read")   # -> true
#   pm.has_permission?("alice", "posts:read")     # -> false
#   pm.has_permission?("bob", "users:write")      # -> false
#   pm.all_permissions("alice")                   # -> #<Set: {"users:write", "billing:read"}>
#   pm.role_permissions("admin")                  # -> #<Set: {"users:write", "billing:read"}>

  #   - P == "*:action"          (wildcard resource)
  #   - P == "*:*"               (superadmin — grants everything)
  #
  # Only "resource:action" formatted permissions are evaluated here.
  # Plain strings without ":" are ignored.

  # Inherited permissions (from Part 2) are included in the check.
  # Return false if no matching permission is found or user doesn't exist.
