# =============================================================================
# Care Team Assignment Manager
# =============================================================================
#
# A remote clinical platform supports patients through a care team. Each care
# team member has a specific role ("coach", "physician", "dietitian", etc.)
# and a maximum number of patients they can hold at one time. A patient may
# have at most one assigned member per role at a time. When a patient is
# reassigned to a different member, the full history of past assignments is
# preserved for audit and care-continuity purposes.
#
# You choose the internal data structures — the public interface is what
# matters.
#
# Store all state in instance variables set in `initialize`. Class variables
# and class-level instance variables will bleed between examples and between
# CareTeamAssignmentManager instances — avoid them.
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Part 1 — Basic assignment and lookup
#   add_member(member_id, role, max_patients)
#   assign(patient_id, member_id, assigned_at)
#   get_assignment(patient_id, role)   -> String or nil
#   get_patients(member_id)            -> Array[String]
#
# Part 2 — Capacity enforcement
#   assign now raises CareTeamAssignmentManager::CapacityError when the member
#   is at max_patients
#   available_members(role)            -> Array[String]
#
# Part 3 — Assignment history
#   get_history(patient_id, role)               -> Array[[String, Float, Float or nil]]
#   get_assignment_at(patient_id, role, timestamp) -> String or nil
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Example
#   mgr = CareTeamAssignmentManager.new
#   mgr.add_member("coach_a", "coach", 2)
#   mgr.add_member("dr_main", "physician", 100)
#   mgr.assign("patient_1", "coach_a", 1000.0)
#   mgr.assign("patient_1", "dr_main", 1000.0)
#   mgr.get_assignment("patient_1", "coach")      # -> "coach_a"
#   mgr.get_assignment("patient_1", "dietitian")  # -> nil
#   mgr.get_patients("coach_a")                   # -> ["patient_1"]
#
#   # Part 2
#   mgr.add_member("coach_b", "coach", 1)
#   mgr.assign("patient_2", "coach_b", 2000.0)
#   mgr.assign("patient_3", "coach_b", 3000.0)  # raises CapacityError
#   mgr.available_members("coach")              # -> ["coach_a"]
#
#   # Part 3 — reassign patient_1 from coach_a to coach_b
#   mgr.assign("patient_1", "coach_b", 5000.0)
#   mgr.get_history("patient_1", "coach")
#   # -> [["coach_a", 1000.0, 5000.0], ["coach_b", 5000.0, nil]]
#   mgr.get_assignment_at("patient_1", "coach",  500.0)  # -> nil (before any assignment)
#   mgr.get_assignment_at("patient_1", "coach", 3000.0)  # -> "coach_a"
#   mgr.get_assignment_at("patient_1", "coach", 6000.0)  # -> "coach_b"

  # Part 2 addition: raises CapacityError if the member is already at
  # max_patients and the patient is not currently assigned to that exact
  # member. (Reassigning a patient who is already on this member does not
  # count as adding a new patient — it is a no-op for capacity purposes.)
