Care Team Assignment Manager
============================

A remote clinical platform supports patients through a care team. Each care
team member has a specific role ("coach", "physician", "dietitian", etc.) and a
maximum number of patients they can hold at one time. A patient may have at most
one assigned member per role at a time. When a patient is reassigned to a
different member, the full history of past assignments is preserved for audit
and care-continuity purposes.

You choose the internal data structures — the public interface is what matters.

Store all state in instance variables initialized in `__init__`.
Class-level variables will bleed between tests and between CareTeamManager
instances — avoid them.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Part 1 — Basic assignment and lookup
  add_member(member_id, role, max_patients)
  assign(patient_id, member_id, assigned_at)
  get_assignment(patient_id, role)   -> Optional[str]
  get_patients(member_id)            -> list[str]

Part 2 — Capacity enforcement
  assign() now raises CapacityError when the member is at max_patients
  available_members(role)            -> list[str]

Part 3 — Assignment history
  get_history(patient_id, role)               -> list[tuple[str, float, Optional[float]]]
  get_assignment_at(patient_id, role, timestamp) -> Optional[str]

# Example
# mgr = CareTeamManager()
# mgr.add_member("coach_a", "coach", max_patients=2)
# mgr.add_member("dr_main", "physician", max_patients=100)
# mgr.assign("patient_1", "coach_a", assigned_at=1000.0)
# mgr.assign("patient_1", "dr_main", assigned_at=1000.0)
# mgr.get_assignment("patient_1", "coach")      # -> "coach_a"
# mgr.get_assignment("patient_1", "dietitian")  # -> None
# mgr.get_patients("coach_a")                   # -> ["patient_1"]
#
# # Part 2
# mgr.add_member("coach_b", "coach", max_patients=1)
# mgr.assign("patient_2", "coach_b", assigned_at=2000.0)
# mgr.assign("patient_3", "coach_b", assigned_at=3000.0)  # raises CapacityError
# mgr.available_members("coach")                # -> ["coach_a"]
#
# # Part 3 — reassign patient_1 from coach_a to coach_b
# mgr.assign("patient_1", "coach_b", assigned_at=5000.0)
# mgr.get_history("patient_1", "coach")
# # -> [("coach_a", 1000.0, 5000.0), ("coach_b", 5000.0, None)]
# mgr.get_assignment_at("patient_1", "coach",  500.0)   # -> None (before any assignment)
# mgr.get_assignment_at("patient_1", "coach", 3000.0)   # -> "coach_a"
