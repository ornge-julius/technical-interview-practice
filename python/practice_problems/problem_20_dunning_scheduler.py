INTERVIEW PROBLEM 20: Subscription Dunning & Retry Scheduler
Difficulty: Senior Software Engineer | Estimated time: 45 min
=============================================================================

CONTEXT
-------
You're building the recurring-billing retry logic for a subscription
platform. When a scheduled charge fails (card declined, insufficient
funds), the platform must not give up immediately — it retries on a
backoff schedule, and if all retries fail, moves the subscription into
dunning and eventually cancels it.

For this problem you are building a DunningManager class.
Store all state in instance variables initialized in `__init__`.
Class-level variables will bleed between tests and between DunningManager
instances — avoid them.
You choose the internal data structures; the public interface is what
matters.

Timestamps are ISO-8601 strings without timezone offset, e.g.
"2024-01-01T00:00:00". Use datetime.fromisoformat()/timedelta for
arithmetic.

RETRY SCHEDULE
--------------
RETRY_INTERVALS_DAYS = [1, 3, 7]
After the Nth consecutive failed attempt (N = 1, 2, 3, ...), the next retry
is scheduled RETRY_INTERVALS_DAYS[N - 1] days after that failed attempt's
timestamp. Once N exceeds len(RETRY_INTERVALS_DAYS) (i.e. a 4th consecutive
failure has occurred), the schedule is exhausted — no further retry is
scheduled.

# Example
# dm = DunningManager()
# dm.create_subscription("sub_1", amount=29.99)
# dm.record_attempt("sub_1", "2024-01-01T00:00:00", succeeded=False)
# # -> {"status": "past_due", "consecutive_failures": 1}
# dm.get_next_retry_time("sub_1")
# # -> "2024-01-02T00:00:00"   (1 day later)
# dm.record_attempt("sub_1", "2024-01-02T00:00:00", succeeded=True)
# # -> {"status": "active", "consecutive_failures": 0}
